<h3>My work</h3>
I am working on wallpapers that are Static and Movie. I then make my work available on Steam (Wallpaper Engine).
<h6></h6>
My goal is to be admired by people for the work I do.
<h3>My goals that I still want to accomplish:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Revision: my current wallpapers</li>
    <li>Revision: my wallpapers in progress</li>
    <li>Create new wallpapers, whether static or movie</li>
    <li>New wallpapers: Create</li>
    <li>Desire: create a 3D wallpaper</li>
    <li>Desire: create a video of the sunset</li>
    <li>Desire: Get orders and fulfill them with pride</li>
    <li>Work: Edit WebPage if time permits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Little story</h3>
<h6></h6>
Currently I invest a lot of time in each wallpaper!. Even if they take a really long time.
I will have to take my time.
<h6></h6>
I hope that I find a partner who sits down with me and we make the wallpapers to 2.
<h6></h6>
I don't make any money from it, but that doesn't bother me. If necessary, I will create a Petreon page where you can
then donate money to me.
<h6></h6>
But I'm not sure if my work should be streamed because I'm afraid of hugging.
<h6></h6>
Anyway, thank you for visiting my site.
